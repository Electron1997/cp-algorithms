# Manhattan Distance

Let $p = (p_1, p_2)$ and $q = (q_1, q_2)$ denote two points in the Euclidean plane. The [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), also known as the taxicab distance, between $p$ and $q$ is defined to be

$$
d(p, q) = \|p_1 - q_1\| + \|p_2 - q_2\|
$$

It is easy to verify that the Manhattan distance indeed satisfies the properties of a metric
